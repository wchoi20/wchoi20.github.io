  abstract    = {Recent work in analyzing inference patterns has suggested that factive predicates exist in English. In this paper, we investigate factivity and veridicality projection of 30 Korean predicates by gathering gradient judgments from native speakers. The preliminary result shows that Korean predicates follow a major projection pattern of English predicates that factivity is observed in emotives and miratives. However, some classes of predicates, such as speculatives and communicatives, do not display a similar pattern, suggesting a difference in general inference pattern between the two languages.},

  abstract    = {In Seoul Korean, it is claimed that the merger of mid-front vowels ᅢ (IPA: /E/) and ᅦ (IPA: /e/) has happened, mainly for younger generations [1]. To revalidate the claim, we conducted an experiment on Korean speakers to pronounce minimal pairs of the mid-front vowels. After analyzing formants and intensity to identify distinctions between two vowels, we claim to support that the merger is present in modern speakers.}
