Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Rochester advised by [Aaron White](https://aaronstevenwhite.io/).

Before that, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science from Johns Hopkins University, where I was advised by [Kyle Rawlins](https://rawlins.io/) and [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). Upon graduation, I was selected as a [2024 Glushko Outstanding Undergraduate Cognitive Scientist](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/2024/05/14/2024-glushko-prize-winner-announced/).

My research interests are in natural language understanding and computational linguistics.

Other than research, I like to travel and watch/play soccer.
