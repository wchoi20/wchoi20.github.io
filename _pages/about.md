Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Rochester advised by Aaron White<a href="https://aaronstevenwhite.io/">. 

Before that, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science from Johns Hopkins University, where I was advised by Kyle Rawlins and Benjamin Van Durme. Upon graduation, I was selected as a 2024 Glushko Outstanding Undergraduate Cognitive Scientist!

My research interests are in natural language understanding and computational linguistics.

Other than research, I like to travel and watch soccer.
